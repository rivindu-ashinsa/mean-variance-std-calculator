# mean-variance-std-calculator
This Python calculator computes statistical metrics such as mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and sum for a given 3x3 matrix. It reshapes 1D lists into matrices and calculates results for rows, columns, and the entire matrix using NumPy. Results are organized into a structured dictionary for easy reference.
